OVERVIEW:
> A simple weather app made with HTML, CSS, and JS!
> I used the free OpenWeatherMap API to get weather 
info.

LAYOUT:
> Search bar to get weather (in city/state/country format)
> Widget section that shows day/night temperatures
for the next seven days (alongside dates + dope 
icons)
> Expanded section that explains the weather more
thoroughly.

NOTE:
> There might be some bugs (I haven't come across
any recently, though).
